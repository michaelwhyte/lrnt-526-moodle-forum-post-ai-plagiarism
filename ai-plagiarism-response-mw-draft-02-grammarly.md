Thank you for posting this infographic from Sarah Eaton. I agree with everything in this infographic. Eaton's (2023) belief that hybrid writing (human writing helped by AI) will become the norm is spot on. This incorporation of tools into our lives has happened since we picked up our first stone and used it to enhance our physical strength. AI is just the latest evolution of humans' constant discovery and creation of technology that makes our day-to-day lives easier. 

If Eaton's prediction becomes accurate and AI-enhanced or hybrid writing becomes the norm soon, we as educators should embrace this technology and learn best how to use it. Hiding from it or preventing its use is an unwinnable position. We owe it to our students, who will be entering a workplace surrounded by AI tools, to help them understand the best ways to leverage these new tools and their benefits and dangers. 

Like any tool, these new AI content generation tools can be misused. Where do we draw the line between what is considered plagiarism and what is original thought? It will be interesting to see what guidelines various professors and institutions create in the coming months and years. We are fortunate to be in education now as we may have a hand in setting ethical guidelines that the next generation of students might use.

As for myself, I feel fortunate that we are in a wild west stage of AI tools, where we don't yet have clear-cut rules for AI and writing. We have to figure out what those rules should be. Guidelines and best practices take time to develop. In the meantime, I think we can all use our instincts and our moral code to help guide us on what might be ethical and what may not. This isn't perfect, but without policies or guidelines, it's the best we have for now.

In my academic writing, I draw the line between having the AI write an entire article or paragraphs. At that point, I am no longer the writer and would claim an article written by another entity (AI) and say it was my own. I am not a gifted natural writer, but I use AI to provide feedback on paragraphs that I have written and rephrase a sentence for clarity if I know what I need to say but can't quite put the correct words together. I also use AI to aid in writing mechanics, such as creating transition sentences. I view these tools as just another writing enhancement tool, like spelling and grammar checkers that came before it. If an instructor believes this goes too far, then I will limit my use of tools such as Grammarly; until then, I feel comfortable ethically using AI in this way for my writing.
