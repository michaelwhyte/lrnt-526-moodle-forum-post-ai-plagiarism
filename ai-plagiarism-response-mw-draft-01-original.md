Thank you for posting this infographic from Sarah Eaton. I agree with everything in this infographic. Eaton's (2023) belief that hybrid writing (human writing helped by AI) will become the norm is spot on. This incorporation of tools into our lives has been happeing since we picked up our first stone and used it to enhance our physical strength. AI is just the latest evolution of humans constant discovery and creation of technology that make our day to day lives easier. 

If Eaton's prediction becomes true and AI enhanced or hybrid writing will become the norm in the near future, we as educators should embrace this technology and learn best how to use it. Hiding from it, or preventing its use is an unwinable position. We owe it to our students, who will be entering a workplace surrounded by AI tools, to help them understand the best ways to leverage these new tools, understand their benefits and dangers. 

Like any tool, these new AI content generation tools can be misused. Where do we draw the line on what is considered plagiarism and what is an original thought? It will be interesting to see what guidelines are created from various professors and institutions in the coming months and years. We are fortunate to be in education at this time as we may have a hand in setting ethical quidelines that might be used by the next generation of students.

As for myself, I feel fortunate that we are in a sort of wild west stage of AI tools, where we don't yet have clear cut rules for AI and writing. We have to figure out what those rules should be. Guidelines and best practices take time to develop. In the meantime I think we can all use our instincts and our own moral code to help quide us on what might be ethical and what may not. This isn't perfect but without policies or guidelines its the best we have for now.

In my academic writing I personally draw the line on having the AI write an entire article or come up with entire paragraphs. At that point I am no longer the writer and would be claiming an article written by another entity (AI) and saying it was my own. Not being a gifted natural writer myself, I use AI for things such as providing feedback on paragraphs that I have written, rephrasing a sentence for clarity if I know what I need to say but can't quite put the correct words together. I also use AI to aid in the mechanics of writing, such as creating transition sentences. In essence I view these tools as just another writing enhancement tool, like spelling and grammer checkers that came before it. If an instructor beliefs this goes to far, then I will limit my use to tools such as grammarly, until then I feel comfortable ethically using AI in this way for my own writing.
