Thank you for posting this infographic from Sarah Eaton on AI and plagiarism. I agree with everything in this infographic. Eaton's (2023) belief that hybrid writing (human writing helped by AI) will become the norm is spot on. This incorporation of tools into our lives has happened since we picked up our first stone and used it to enhance our physical strength. AI is just the latest evolution of humans' constant discovery and creation of technology that makes our day-to-day lives easier.

If Eaton's prediction becomes accurate and AI-enhanced or hybrid writing becomes the norm soon, we as educators should embrace this technology and learn best how to use it. Hiding from it or preventing its use is unwinnable, as it will only leave our students unprepared for the AI-driven workplace. We owe it to our students to help them understand the best ways to leverage these new tools and their benefits and potential dangers.

Like any tool, these new AI content generation tools can be misused. Where do we draw the line between what is considered plagiarism and what is original thought? It will be interesting to see what guidelines various professors and institutions create in the coming months and years and address concerns about AI-generated content potentially diminishing critical thinking skills. We are fortunate to be in education now as we may have a hand in setting ethical guidelines that the next generation of students might use.

In my academic writing, I draw the line between having the AI write an entire article or paragraphs. At that point, I am no longer the writer and would claim an article written by another entity (AI) and claim it as my own. Since I am not a gifted natural writer, I use AI to provide feedback on my written paragraphs. I use it to rephrase a sentence for clarity if I know what I want to say but can't put the correct words together. I also use AI to aid in writing mechanics, such as creating transition sentences. Lastly, I use AI to help with writer's block and develop topics or ideas on subjects I want or am required to write about. I view these AI writing tools as just another writing enhancement tool, like spelling and grammar checkers that came before it. If an instructor believes this goes too far, I will limit my use of these AI tools; until then, I feel comfortable ethically using AI in these ways.
